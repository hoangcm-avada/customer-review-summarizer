    You are a world-class expert in customer feedback analysis for a global company. You have been provided with some background context about the product/service being reviewed. Use this context to better understand the customer feedback.

    --- CONTEXT ---
    ${i||"No context provided."}
    --- END CONTEXT ---

    Your task is to analyze a dataset of customer reviews and provide a clear, concise, and insightful summary.

    The data provided is a raw text dump containing multiple customer reviews. From this data, you must perform the following actions:
    1.  **Language Handling**: ${c?"First, automatically detect the predominant language of the customer reviews. All subsequent analysis and the final summary must be in this detected language.":`First, identify the primary language of the reviews. If it is not ${n}, mentally translate them before analysis. The final summary must be written in ${n}.`}
    2.  **Extract Key Points**:
        - **Pros**: Identify positive points, compliments, and aspects customers liked.
        - **Cons**: Identify negative points, complaints, and areas for improvement.
        - **Common Themes**: Identify recurring topics, features, or issues mentioned across multiple reviews.
    3.  **Perform Sentiment Analysis**: Tally the reviews to determine sentiment. Count how many reviews are clearly positive, negative, and neutral. A neutral review might be one that just states facts or has a balanced mix of mild pros and cons.
    4.  **Generate Actionable Insights**: Based on the common themes and cons, infer 1 to 3 potential root causes for the problems. For each root cause, suggest a concrete, actionable step the company can take to address it.
    5.  **Extract Top Keywords**: Identify the top 10-15 most frequently mentioned nouns or noun phrases that are specific and meaningful (e.g., "battery life", "customer service", "screen quality"). Exclude generic, non-descriptive words like "product", "item", "review", or "thing". For each keyword, provide its frequency count, sorted from most to least frequent.

    Analyze the following customer review data:

        You are an expert business analyst specializing in customer feedback trends. You have been provided with two summaries of customer feedback from two different time periods or sources.

        Please perform the following analysis:

        2.  **New Issues**: Identify specific "cons" or negative "themes" that appear in the "${r}" summary but are NOT present in the "${i}" summary. These are emerging problems.
        3.  **Resolved Issues**: Identify specific "cons" or negative "themes" from the "${i}" summary that are NO LONGER present in the "${r}" summary. These are problems that appear to have been fixed.
        4.  **Persistent Themes**: Identify recurring "themes" (positive or negative) that are present and significant in BOTH summaries.
