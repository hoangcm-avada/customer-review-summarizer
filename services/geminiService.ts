    --- CONTEXT ---
    ${productContext || "No context provided."}
    --- END CONTEXT ---

    Your task is to analyze a dataset of customer reviews and provide a clear, concise, and insightful summary.

    The data provided is a raw text dump containing multiple customer reviews. From this data, you must perform the following actions:
    1.  **Language Handling**: ${isAutoDetect 
      ? 'First, automatically detect the predominant language of the customer reviews. All subsequent analysis and the final summary must be in this detected language.' 
      : `First, identify the primary language of the reviews. If it is not ${outputLanguage}, mentally translate them before analysis. The final summary must be written in ${outputLanguage}.`}
    2.  **Extract Key Points**:
        - **Pros**: Identify positive points, compliments, and aspects customers liked.
        - **Cons**: Identify negative points, complaints, and areas for improvement.
        - **Common Themes**: Identify recurring topics, features, or issues mentioned across multiple reviews.
    3.  **Perform Sentiment Analysis**: Tally the reviews to determine sentiment. Count how many reviews are clearly positive, negative, and neutral. A neutral review might be one that just states facts or has a balanced mix of mild pros and cons.
    4.  **Generate Actionable Insights**: Based on the common themes and cons, infer 1 to 3 potential root causes for the problems. For each root cause, suggest a concrete, actionable step the company can take to address it.
    5.  **Extract Top Keywords**: Identify the top 10-15 most frequently mentioned nouns or noun phrases that are specific and meaningful (e.g., "battery life", "customer service", "screen quality"). Exclude generic, non-descriptive words like "product", "item", "review", or "thing". For each keyword, provide its frequency count, sorted from most to least frequent.

    Analyze the following customer review data:

        You are a market research analyst AI. You have been given several summaries of customer feedback, each corresponding to a different customer segment (persona). Your task is to perform a comparative analysis to highlight the unique differences between these segments.

        Here are the feedback summaries for each segment:
        --- DATA ---
        ${JSON.stringify(summaries, null, 2)}
        --- END DATA ---

        Please perform the following analysis in ${isAutoDetect ? 'the same language as the provided summaries' : language} and return the result as a single, structured JSON object:
        1.  **Overall Overview**: Write a brief, high-level overview (2-3 sentences) summarizing the most significant differences or similarities in feedback across all the customer segments.
        2.  **Segment-Specific Differentiators**: For each individual segment, analyze its summary (pros, cons, themes) in comparison to all other segments. Identify 2-3 key points of feedback that are either unique to this segment or significantly more prominent than in others. These should be the most defining characteristics of their experience.

        The goal is to understand what makes each customer segment distinct. Focus on contrast and uniqueness. Do not just list their pros and cons; explain what makes them different from the others.
